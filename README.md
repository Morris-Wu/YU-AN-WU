I am a person who is willing to challenge. When my parents asked me to choose my college career freely, I made the decision of "don't choose comfort at the age when I should strive" and devoted myself to the educational cooperation plan between Yangming Jiaotong University and the Institute of Technology of National Defense University. I also learned the spirit of teamwork in various tasks and was good at analyzing in the face of difficulties. Problems and quickly find solutions to ensure the smooth achievement of the chief's goals.

I come from a three-generation family, and the members include grandparents, parents, younger brother, sister and me.
